    "title": "Frequently asked questions",
    "q1": {
      "question": "What is VVTerm?",
      "answer": "VVTerm is an SSH terminal app for iOS and macOS. It lets you manage and connect to remote servers (VPS, cloud instances, home lab) with iCloud sync across all your Apple devices."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How does iCloud sync work?",
      "answer": "Server configurations (name, host, port, username) sync via iCloud to all your devices. Passwords and SSH keys are stored in Apple Keychain and sync via iCloud Keychain when iCloud sync is enabled."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Which authentication methods are supported?",
      "answer": "Standard SSH auth supports password, SSH key, and SSH key with passphrase. VVTerm also supports Mosh, Tailscale SSH, and Cloudflare Tunnel SSH. Credentials are stored securely in Apple Keychain when required."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Does VVTerm work on iPad?",
      "answer": "Yes! VVTerm works on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The iOS version has a keyboard toolbar with Esc, Tab, Ctrl, and arrow keys for easy terminal navigation."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "What terminal emulator does it use?",
      "answer": "VVTerm uses libghostty, the same GPU-accelerated terminal rendering engine from Ghostty. It provides fast, accurate terminal emulation with custom theme support."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "What's included in Free vs Pro?",
      "answer": "Free includes 1 workspace, 3 servers, and 1 connection tab — enough for personal use. Pro unlocks unlimited everything: workspaces, servers, simultaneous connections, and custom environments."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "Can I use one purchase on multiple devices?",
      "answer": "Yes. Your Pro purchase syncs via App Store. Sign in with the same Apple ID on all your devices to unlock Pro everywhere."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "What's the refund policy?",
      "answer": "Refunds are handled by Apple via the App Store. To request one, use Apple's official refund flow at reportaproblem.apple.com. We can't issue refunds directly, but we're happy to help if you're having trouble."
    },
    "q9": {
      "question": "What are the system requirements?",
      "answer": "iOS 16+ (iPhone, iPad) or macOS 13+ Ventura (Apple Silicon only). Intel Macs are not supported due to GPU driver limitations."
